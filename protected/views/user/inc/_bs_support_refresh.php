                    <p class="view_line">Refreshing is an easy thing to do. You can click on the arrow on the top browser bar (third icon) to refresh the page.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">You can also use a keyboard shortcut. On Windows, it is usually the F5 button on the top of your keyboard (you may have to do a combination with an FN key). For Mac users, it is usually the COMMAND+R key combination on your keyboard.</p>
