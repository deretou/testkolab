                    <p class="view_title">Steps</p>
                    <p class="view_line">We know that if you REALLY want to use those development tools, you can easily find a way to do so.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">We're a bunch of hackers ourselves, so we know how important it is to tinker with code and learn stuff. The thing is, there's two sides on tinkering.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">On the bright side there's the hackers; people there to find major vulnerabilities in kolab. It's because of them that we live in a safer world because they find security holes and share their discovery so that they can be fixed! That's the good side, people looking to break things and then informing the community of the flaw of it to be fixed. To all of you, that's great; you're breaking things on your own for your personal learning.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">On the ugly side there's the disruptors; people just trying to find ways to piss off other people. It's because of them that we live in a world where we have to put restrictions and warning messages like this. That's the bad side, people looking to break things because they simply suck. We get that you don't like working on that homework with those two other people, but is it really a reason to go in the code and console and try to break the document for everybody? We have Tetris in our app catalog... we're giving you freaking Tetris!</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">So yeah, that's why you see this message. Code isn't unbreakable, you gotta be an idiot to think that, and we're not. We just want to put a line between someone tinkering to learn and someone trying to break and annoy.</p>
