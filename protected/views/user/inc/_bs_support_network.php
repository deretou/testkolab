                    <p class="view_line">Make sure you have a working internet connection and nothing is blocking kolab in your computer or network.</p>

                    <p class="view_title">Steps</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">If you are using a wired connection, check that all the cables are properly plugged in. If you are using a wireless connection, check that you are on the right network, with the right password and in range.</p>
                    
                    	
                    
                    <p class="view_line">If you are at home and the internet connectivity is no longer working, you can try to unplug all your network equipment like your modem and router, wait a couple of minutes and plug it back. Restarting the computer might also help.</p>
                    
                    	
                    
                    <p class="view_line">If you have internet connectivity, where other websites like Google or Wikipedia are functioning properly and kolab is the exception, please check this link to ensure that kolab is online and not under maintenance or experiencing technical difficulties. Disable any browser plugin that may intercept, manage or filter your connection to kolab.</p>
                    
                    	
                    
					<p class="view_line">In all cases you should contact your network administrator to ensure that you have a proper internet connection and that kolab is correctly allowed on your network. We recommend that you give your home, school or office administrator this information to ensure your network is allowing a proper connection to kolab.</p>
