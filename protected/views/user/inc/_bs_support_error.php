                    <p class="view_line">All right, so there isn't a lot you can do here. This kind of problem is usually on our side.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">Now, in some rare consequences there might be something on your side that caused this. Make sure that you do not have any Chrome Extension or external plugin affecting kolab (and if you're not using Google Chrome on the first place... there's your problem). Also, keep your Google Chrome updated as versions under 35 have known issues since we're using the latest technology available.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">The last thing you can try is to clear your browser data like your cookies, cache and stored plugin information. Close everything related to kolab entirely and just purge everything from your browser. If you don't know how to do this, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95582?hl=en" target="_blank">here's a link from Google</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">Other than that, you should check the Feedback section of kolab, social networks, your friends or the web to know if anybody else is experiencing this problem. If you can't find anything about this, and it is reccuring, get in contact with us.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_title">Details</p>
                    <p class="view_line">Usually this occurs when a user is clicking on a specific content that is currently unavailable. This is a loading mistake where the content was supposed to be loaded and ready to use, but is unfortunately not found in the loaded code. A conflict in the code is also possible where kolab is requesting data and is receiving an unexpected answer.</p>
                    
                    <p class="view_line">Refreshing the page and clearing the cache are really the way to fix this problem as it will force a complete reload of kolab which might properly include the required content this time or fix the conflict. Otherwise, it's really a problem on our side.</p>
